# Main features

- This model has three layers, crust, lid (lithospheric mantle) and asthenosphere.
- Each layer has a uniform thickness: Depths to the bottom of each layer are 35, 100 and 400 km.
- The rupture surface
    - is centered around (1500 km, 900 km)
    - is planar, 500 x 200 km.
    - has a strike and a dip of 200$^{\circ}$ and 12$^{\circ}$.
    - has a uniform slip of 25 m.
- Gravity is not included.
